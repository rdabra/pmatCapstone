# pmat: A Simple C++ Library for Matrix Operations

This is the repository of the C++ source code of a static library for basic operations with matrices, including some matrix decompositions (PLU, PQR, etc.) which enable the solution of linear systems and the calculation of important magnitudes such as determinants, inverse matrices, rank and others. The library currently provides a multithreaded version for matrix multiplication aiming to implement in the near future more operations and magnitudes in their multithreaded versions.

This effort is also the Capstone Project (Option One) submitted by the author to his Udacity C++ Nanodegree Course as the final work to be evaluated.

| Memory Management           | The project uses move semantics to move data, instead of copying it, where possible.           | MatrixSquare.cpp           | 11                   |
| Memory Management           | The project uses smart pointers instead of raw pointers.                                       | TMultiplicationManager.h   | 21                   |

## Documentation

The content of documentation directory was generated by [doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) outputted to html and pdf. In the html version, [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) was used to draw the [Latex](https://www.latex-project.org/) commands. Additionally to the usual description of data, functions and classes, the generated documentation also presents class diagrams such as the following, in which the hierarchy of matrix classes is shown.
